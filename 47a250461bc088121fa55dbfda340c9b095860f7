      "message": "\u003e This is not true, at least one other project transitively uses this dependency to avoid having their own meson overhead since it was inteded to be used broadly.\n\nI noticed that.  It seems like sdeventplus and phosphor-networkd are relying on that presently.\n\n\u003e c++23 doesn\u0027t have a fu2::function_view analog.\n\nThere is exactly one use of `function_view` today and that is in phosphor-networkd.  It seems like `std::move_only_function\u0026` could be used in all of the cases that phosphor-networkd is currently using `function_view`.\n\nIf we can get phosphor-networkd moved to move_only_function is there any other strong reason to keep function2 around?",
